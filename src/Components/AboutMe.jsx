      <p>
        I&apos;m a web developer based in Brooklyn, NY. I am proficient in
        React, JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, HTML, and Git, and I enjoy building
        engaging, responsive websites and applications that reflect my interests
        in art and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a dedicated, quick, and fastidious learner: I taught myself to
        code over the past year, and I&apos;m eager to learn as much about
        front-end development as I can going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m also a fine art painter and illustrator, and I am experienced
        in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma for UI and design.
      </p>
